This is a challenge on transformation of data

When running the script it looks like this when using it:
Please enter your recipe for frying: Test_To_See_If_This_Works
got:      `_sees_TfthIsSr__WTikeT_oo`
expected: `1_n3}f3br9Ty{_6_rHnf01fg_14rlbtB60tuarun0c_tr1y3`
This recipe isn't right :(


Run Ghidar and import the script into it
Look at the functions tab on the right as I clicked through on the code on the left

Found the main function in the code and found out it took our input and put it into the fryer funch

Went to the fryer function in Ghidar
Took the code from Fryer and Main and put it into Claude AI

To see if there is a way to revers the code
Tried to use the code but it was giving me python code and the Main anf Fryer function are in C

We then start trying to get the code to out put in c and ended up getting this code:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void reverse_fryer(char text, int length) {
    unsigned int seed = 0x13377331;
    char temp;

    // Store random numbers first
    intrandom_nums = malloc(sizeof(int) * length);
    for(int i = 0; i < length - 1; i++) {
        random_nums[i] = rand_r(&seed);
    }

    // Reverse the shuffling
    for(int i = length - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        int swap_idx = (random_nums[i] % (length - i)) + i;
        temp = text[i];
        text[i] = text[swap_idx];
        text[swap_idx] = temp;
    }

    free(random_nums);
}

int main() {
    char desired[] = "1_n3}f3br9Ty{_6_rHnf01fg_14rlbtB60tuarun0c_tr1y3";
    int length = strlen(desired);
    char *text = strdup(desired);

    reverse_fryer(text, length);
    printf("Original string: %s\n", text);

    free(text);
    return 0;
}

This worked and output the correct flage
