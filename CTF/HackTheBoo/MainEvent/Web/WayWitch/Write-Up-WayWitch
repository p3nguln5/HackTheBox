First thing I did was start a nmap scan of the website (See that is the nmap file)


Going to the web-page the first thing I did not inspect elements F12

In the <script> section of the HTML I found a token maker script for the page

I took the code and edited so I could make an admin tocken
I used https://onecompiler.com/html/ to compile the html online and got this:
  eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6ImFkbWluIiwicm9sZSI6ImFkbWluIiwiaWF0IjoxNzI5Nzg1NTExfQ.opU7nDXUNoSFF6F250MXbJrMj3sQe8onJhG2Y9PGSt8

Then I used burpsuite to try and put my own generated token
  When using my own token on the website I get  a response saying "Ticket submitted successfully", but nothing happened

After nothing showed up I search for a bit and then we used FUZZ to see if we could find a sub-domain

We did find on using this command: ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u https://83.136.254.37:40229/FUZZ
  Finding us the /tickets

Going to this we can not accesses it unless we are admin.
Good for use that we got an admin token
Using the admin token with burpsuite we get into the page and find the flag in the list of tickets
