Running the "pass" elf file it ask for a password input

Used the "xxd -g -l <file>" command on the elf file
this gave me a hexdump of the file

Looking at the hex values I found the part of the hex where it is asking for a password
At this section I found a secret password in plain test in the hex data

Using this secret password when promoted after running the "pass" file I get the flag
