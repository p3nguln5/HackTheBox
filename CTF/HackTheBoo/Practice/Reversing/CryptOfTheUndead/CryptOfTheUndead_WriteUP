This challenge had two files crypt and file.txt.undead

running ./crypt it wants a file to encrypt

giving it a file with data in it it encrypts it and addes the .undead to it
  EX: test.txt >>> ./crypt test.txt >>> test.txt.undead

trying to put the .undead file back in did not work

What I did was removed .undead from the file and ran crypt on the file again

This worked and decrypt the file
